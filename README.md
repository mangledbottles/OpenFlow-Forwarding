# OpenFlow UDP Socket Protocol
![OpenFlow Network](assets/Network.png)
This project is an implementation of the OpenFlow Protocol using the NodeJS UDP Datagram Socket. 

The core functionality of this system provides a front-end user interface for the client which connects to the OpenFlow Network.

The OpenFlow network consists of a number of routers that forward messages and are controlled by a centralised switcher.
## Installation
